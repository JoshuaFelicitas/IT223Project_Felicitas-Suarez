                        their furry customers, and he knew that he could do better. Despite the challenges of starting a new business in the midst of a pandemic, Joshua persevered.
                        He worked tirelessly to create a welcoming, pet-friendly environment where customers could find

                        Tails is more than just a pet storeâ€”it's a place where pet owners can come to find support,
                        advice, and a friendly smile. At Happy Tails, Joshua and his team are committed to providing only the best for their customers'
                        furry friends. They carefully select each product they offer, ensuring that it meets the highest
                        standards of quality and safety. From food and treats to toys and accessories, pet owners can
